\subsection{Goal}

We want to create a new device that maps hand and finger movements to key
presses -- just like a traditional keyboard, but without the bulky and
restraining hardware that's currently required for keyboard input.

To do so, we want to attach multiple movement sensors (inertial measurement
units, IMUs\footnote{These usually combine multidimensional gyroscopes,
accelerometers and magnetometers in one package, giving us access to the linear
and angular acceleration as well as absolute orientation of the device.}) to
different parts of the hand and record their outputs, including the
corresponding keystrokes from an actual keyboard.

We will then analyze the collected data to learn how hand movements translate
into keystrokes. To do so, we will use a machine learning algorithm that can
later be fed with live sensor data to replace the tranditional keyboard in
generating the keystrokes.

We believe a neural network is very suitable for this task, as it might be able
to detect small differences in the way the user pushes different keys that are
not predicable and specific for the actual user. Our goal is therefore not to
create a universally applicable device, but learn one person's typing gestures
with adequate accuracy to be usable as an input device.
