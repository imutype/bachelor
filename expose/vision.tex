\subsection{Vision}

If our experimental prototype proves to be suitable for precise keyboard input,
we can envision to take the idea further.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the device universally applicable, without the need to
    train a complex network. Collect more data to generalize better and provide
    a ``starting point'' for customized user profiles.
    \item Optimize the hardware. Make it lighter, smaller, more robust,
    cheaper.  Replace wires with wireless connections. 
    \item Use sensor data from hardware for robotics applications.
    \item Use the same hardware and principle to replace other input
    devices, e.g. piano keyboard, braille typing device, gesture recognition.
    \item Improve ergonomic properties.
    \item Perform online learning\footnote{keep learning from the system's own
    output to keep track of small adjustments over time} to move away from the
    predetermined key layout of traditional keyboards.  
\end{itemize}
